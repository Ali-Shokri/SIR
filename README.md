In this thesis we study the quantum scattering of ultra-cold fermionic particle and separation induced resonance in quasi-one dimensional system. We deploy grid method
to investigate the quantum scattering for two particle in two separated constriant with transverse harmonic potential well in low energy limit. We show that due to tuning the separation in such system for sepacial state of energy and distance we can see two induced resonace which is called dual separation induced resonance
